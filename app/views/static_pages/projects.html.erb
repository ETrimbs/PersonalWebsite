<h1>Projects</h1>
<p class="essay">
Over the years, I have had the opportunity to work on a number of different technologies. Some of these experiences 
have been curated by my classes at UMass Amherst, some by my mentors at Fidelity Investments, and some have been pursued 
personally due to pure interest in seeking new ways to provide value to the world.<br>
Here are some of my favorite projects I have worked on broken down by specific coding language or skill. 
I hope this inspires you as well as it has me!
