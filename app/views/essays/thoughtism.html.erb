<br/><span class="tab"></span>Thoughtists seek to study the causes and derive insights from anything which is outside the bounds of physics. What is outside the bounds of physics? Thought, for one thing. If I have a physics experiment where I have a closed, static room, paused in time, containing a ball on top of a ramp, and I hit 'play', I can calculate exactly how fast the ball will go, the position it will end up in, and in essence everything that will happen at every moment in that closed system. That is physics. 
<br/><span class="tab"></span>If I then have that same room setup, with the addition of a human being, then all-of-a-sudden, physics completely breaks down. I cannot, in any reasonable way using the physical model, predict how the human will interact with the elements in the room and what the final state of the room will be at any given time. 
<br/><span class="tab"></span>One may say that with perfect knowledge of the atoms of the human and infinite calculation, I would be able to predict exactly what will happen within the frame of physics. I counter that point by saying that we do not have the compute to do that right now and, perhaps, we will never have such compute. Further, it may be impossible to run such a computation with the physical model as in the physical model there are many elements of the problem which are defined as unknowable (Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle). To lay this counterargument to rest,  we may find that it is impossible to run such exact calculations of the physical world on hardware that also must have a place in the physical world; in any case, it is not doable right now anyways. 
<br/><span class="tab"></span>Therefore, we need a new paradigm of thought about the world that is outside of and yet encompasses all of physics and, indeed, outside of all science. An all-encompassing idea of the world is one which can explain itself;: the idea can describe the phenomenon that is itself; an idea that lives in a human mind.  Science cannot do this as science cannot describe the phenomenon that is the idea of science; it may only describe a certain high percentage of the physical world and not the world ideas. What science does right now to combat this failure is to assume itself to be a fundamental truth in the universe. I posit that since truth is merely an idea living in the human mind, and the human mind by definition is subjective, that the idea that a single idea can claim itself as a fundamental truth just does not make sense as a statement. Therefore, since the field of science relies on assumptions about the world which have just been proven untrue, science cannot claim to be a field which encompasses all the fundamental truths of the universe. It is merely a thought in a thought-driven model of the universe which we will refer henceforth as 'thoughtism'.
